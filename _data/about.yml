- title: "What is Africa Muslim Fest?"
  excerpt: |
    **Africa Muslim Fest** is **not a single event but an ecosystem** of communities,
    events, and organisations that will converge in Cape Town, South Africa.

    The city will host the first-ever Africa Muslim Fest â€” a celebration of Muslim innovation,
    culture, and futures rooted in our tradition.

    Instead of one organizer controlling the program, **we bring together many partners**:
    tech conferences, cultural showcases, wellness sessions, business forums,
    social impact initiatives, and spiritual gatherings. Each event has its own identity,
    but together they form part of the **Africa Muslim Fest experience**.
